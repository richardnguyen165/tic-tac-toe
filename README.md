## Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a tic-tac-toe game for TOP (The Odin Project). It can allow you to play with another player, and allow you to view match history, as well as view moves for each specific match. This project mainly focuses on developing modules (stage one) and developing class (stage two), as well as the usage of them, rather then relying on global code.
