Modules?

Board() -> responsible for the board, state of the board, action that allow player to change the cell (console, phase 1)

displayController() -> responsible for manipulating the DOM to show the game, and other elements (UI, phase 2)

gameController() -> responsible for player interaction (console, phase 1)

Cell() -> responsible for each cell of the board, changes depending on what player clicked (console, phase 1)
